A Swagger UI has been implemented to provide documentation, an interface for users, with little or no programming experience, to 'talk' to the services to quickly and easily formulate queries with the services and obtain dynamically generated source code for popular programming languages, such as Java, Perl, Python and Ruby. Search results are returned as standard JSON, XML or GFF data objects. The Proteins API is a scalable, reliable, fast, easy to use RESTful services that provides a broad protein information resource for users to ask questions based upon their field of expertise and allowing them to gain an integrated overview of protein annotations available to aid their knowledge gain on proteins in biological processes.

The database contains over 60 million sequences, of which over half a million sequences have been curated by experts who critically review experimental and predicted data for each protein. The remainder are automatically annotated based on rule systems that rely on the expert curated knowledge. Since our last update in 2014, we have more than doubled the number of reference proteomes to 5631, giving a greater coverage of taxonomic diversity. We implemented a pipeline to remove redundant highly similar proteomes that were causing excessive redundancy in UniProt. The initial run of this pipeline reduced the number of sequences in UniProt by 47 million. For our users interested in the accessory proteomes, we have made available sets of pan proteome sequences that cover the diversity of sequences for each species that is found in its strains and sub-strains. To help interpretation of genomic variants, we provide tracks of detailed protein information for the major genome browsers. We provide a SPARQL endpoint that allows complex queries of the more than 22 billion triples of data in UniProt (http://sparql.uniprot.org/). UniProt resources can be accessed via the website at http://www.uniprot.org/.},

Here, we describe the guidelines of this collaborative effort, the current status of contributed data, and the PDBe-KB infrastructure, which includes the data exchange format, the deposition system for added value annotations, the distributable database containing the assembled data, and programmatic access endpoints. We also describe a series of novel web-pages-the PDBe-KB aggregated views of structure data-which combine information on macromolecular structures from many PDB entries. We have recently released the first set of pages in this series, which provide an overview of available structural and functional information for a protein of interest, referenced by a UniProtKB accession.},

Here based on a carefully assembled data set derived from experimental data for proteins in solution, we quantify backbone dynamics properties on the amino-acid level and develop DynaMine--a fast, high-quality predictor of protein backbone dynamics. DynaMine uses only protein sequence information as input and shows great potential in distinguishing regions of different structural organization, such as folded domains, disordered linkers, molten globules and pre-structured binding motifs of different sizes. It also identifies disordered regions within proteins with an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated existing predictors, without depending on prior disorder knowledge or three-dimensional structural information. DynaMine provides molecular biologists with an important new method that grasps the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, as we show here for human p53 and E1A from human adenovirus 5.},

Especially poorly understood are the very early stages of protein folding, which are likely defined by intrinsic local interactions between amino acids close to each other in the protein sequence. We here present EFoldMine, a method that predicts, from the primary amino acid sequence of a protein, which amino acids are likely involved in early folding events. The method is based on early folding data from hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) data from NMR pulsed labelling experiments, and uses backbone and sidechain dynamics as well as secondary structure propensities as features. The EFoldMine predictions give insights into the folding process, as illustrated by a qualitative comparison with independent experimental observations. Furthermore, on a quantitative proteome scale, the predicted early folding residues tend to become the residues that interact the most in the folded structure, and they are often residues that display evolutionary covariation. The connection of the EFoldMine predictions with both folding pathway data and the folded protein structure suggests that the initial statistical behavior of the protein chain with respect to local structure formation has a lasting effect on its subsequent states.},

  abstract        = {Depth measures the extent of atom/residue burial within a protein. It correlates with properties such as protein stability, hydrogen exchange rate, protein-protein interaction hot spots, post-translational modification sites and sequence variability. Our server, DEPTH, accurately computes depth and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) values. We show that depth can be used to predict small molecule ligand binding cavities in proteins. Often, some of the residues lining a ligand binding cavity are both deep and solvent exposed. Using the depth-SASA pair values for a residue, its likelihood to form part of a small molecule binding cavity is estimated. The parameters of the method were calibrated over a training set of 900 high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of single-domain proteins bound to small molecules (molecular weight <1.5  KDa). The prediction accuracy of DEPTH is comparable to that of other geometry-based prediction methods including LIGSITE, SURFNET and Pocket-Finder (all with Matthew's correlation coefficient of ∼0.4) over a testing set of 225 single and multi-chain protein structures. Users have the option of tuning several parameters to detect cavities of different sizes, for example, geometrically flat binding sites. The input to the server is a protein 3D structure in PDB format. The users have the option of tuning the values of four parameters associated with the computation of residue depth and the prediction of binding cavities. The computed depths, SASA and binding cavity predictions are displayed in 2D plots and mapped onto 3D representations of the protein structure using Jmol. Links are provided to download the outputs. Our server is useful for all structural analysis based on residue depth and SASA, such as guiding site-directed mutagenesis experiments and small molecule docking exercises, in the context of protein functional annotation and drug discovery.},

  abstract     = {Ligand binding site prediction from protein structure has many applications related to elucidation of protein function and structure based drug discovery. It often represents only one step of many in complex computational drug design efforts. Although many methods have been published to date, only few of them are suitable for use in automated pipelines or for processing large datasets. These use cases require stability and speed, which disqualifies many of the recently introduced tools that are either template based or available only as web servers. We present P2Rank, a stand-alone template-free tool for prediction of ligand binding sites based on machine learning. It is based on prediction of ligandability of local chemical neighbourhoods that are centered on points placed on the solvent accessible surface of a protein. We show that P2Rank outperforms several existing tools, which include two widely used stand-alone tools (Fpocket, SiteHound), a comprehensive consensus based tool (MetaPocket 2.0), and a recent deep learning based method (DeepSite). P2Rank belongs to the fastest available tools (requires under 1 s for prediction on one protein), with additional advantage of multi-threaded implementation. P2Rank is a new open source software package for ligand binding site prediction from protein structure. It is available as a user-friendly stand-alone command line program and a Java library. P2Rank has a lightweight installation and does not depend on other bioinformatics tools or large structural or sequence databases. Thanks to its speed and ability to make fully automated predictions, it is particularly well suited for processing large datasets or as a component of scalable structural bioinformatics pipelines.},

We assess predictions of ten representative geometry-, energy-, threading-, and consensus-based methods on a new benchmark data set that considers apo and holo protein structures with multiple binding sites for biologically relevant ligands. Statistical tests show that threading-based Findsite outperforms other predictors when its templates have high similarity with the input protein. However, Findsite is equivalent or inferior to some geometry-, energy-, and consensus-based methods when the similarity is lower. We demonstrate that geometry-, energy-, and consensus-based predictors benefit from the usage of holo structures and that the top four methods, Findsite, Q-SiteFinder, ConCavity, and MetaPocket, perform better for larger binding sites. Predictions from these four methods are complementary, and our simple meta-predictor improves over the best single predictor.},

The biological function insights in these three aspects are then deduced from the functional templates, the confidence of which is evaluated by a scoring function that combines both global and local structural similarities. The algorithm has been extensively benchmarked by large-scale benchmarking tests and demonstrated significant advantages compared to traditional sequence-based methods.

However, there is no method that could generate optimal binding site prediction for different protein types. Combination of complementary predictions is probably the most reliable solution to the problem. We develop two new methods, one based on binding-specific substructure comparison (TM-SITE) and another on sequence profile alignment (S-SITE), for complementary binding site predictions. The methods are tested on a set of 500 non-redundant proteins harboring 814 natural, drug-like and metal ion molecules. Starting from low-resolution protein structure predictions, the methods successfully recognize >51% of binding residues with average Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) significantly higher (with P-value <10(-9) in student t-test) than other state-of-the-art methods, including COFACTOR, FINDSITE and ConCavity. When combining TM-SITE and S-SITE with other structure-based programs, a consensus approach (COACH) can increase MCC by 15% over the best individual predictions. COACH was examined in the recent community-wide COMEO experiment and consistently ranked as the best method in last 22 individual datasets with the Area Under the Curve score 22.5% higher than the second best method. These data demonstrate a new robust approach to protein-ligand binding site recognition, which is ready for genome-wide structure-based function annotations. http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/},

Here, we continue our previous work by adding four more methods Fpocket, GHECOM, ConCavity and POCASA to further improve the prediction success rate. The new method MetaPocket 2.0 and the individual approaches are all tested on two datasets of 48 unbound/bound and 210 bound structures as used before. The results show that the average success rate has been raised 5% at the top 1 prediction compared with previous work. Moreover, we construct a non-redundant dataset of drug-target complexes with known structure from DrugBank, DrugPort and PDB database and apply MetaPocket 2.0 to this dataset to predict drug binding sites. As a result, >74% drug binding sites on protein target are correctly identified at the top 3 prediction, and it is 12% better than the best individual approach.

For the holo structures, all four algorithms correctly identified a similar amount of pockets (around 95%). SiteFinder, using optimized parameters, SiteMap, and fpocket showed similar pocket ranking performance, which was defined by ranking the correct binding site on rank 1 of the predictions or within the first 5 ranks of the predictions. On the apo structures, PocketFinder especially and also SiteFinder (optimized parameters) performed best, identifying 96% and 84% of all binding sites, respectively. The fpocket program predicts binding sites most accurately among the algorithms evaluated here.

Nowadays, although many computational methods for ligand-binding prediction have been developed, there is still a demanding to improve the prediction accuracy and efficiency. In addition, most of these methods are purely geometry-based, if the prediction methods improvement could be succeeded by integrating physicochemical or sequence properties of protein-ligand binding, it may also be more helpful to address the biological question in such studies. In our study, in order to investigate the contribution of sequence conservation in binding sites prediction and to make up the insufficiencies in purely geometry based methods, a simple yet efficient protein-binding sites prediction algorithm is presented, based on the geometry-based cavity identification integrated with sequence conservation information. Our method was compared with the other three classical tools: PocketPicker, SURFNET, and PASS, and evaluated on an existing comprehensive dataset of 210 non-redundant protein-ligand complexes. The results demonstrate that our approach correctly predicted the binding sites in 59% and 75% of cases among the TOP1 candidates and TOP3 candidates in the ranking list, respectively, which performs better than those of SURFNET and PASS, and achieves generally a slight better performance with PocketPicker. Our work has successfully indicated the importance of the sequence conservation information in binding sites prediction as well as provided a more accurate way for binding sites identification.},

P2Rank is a template-free machine learning method based on the prediction of local chemical neighborhood ligandability centered on points placed on a solvent-accessible protein surface. Points with a high ligandability score are then clustered to form the resulting ligand binding sites. In addition, PrankWeb provides a web interface enabling users to easily carry out the prediction and visually inspect the predicted binding sites via an integrated sequence-structure view. Moreover, PrankWeb can determine sequence conservation for the input molecule and use this in both the prediction and result visualization steps. Alongside its online visualization options, PrankWeb also offers the possibility of exporting the results as a PyMOL script for offline visualization. The web frontend communicates with the server side via a REST API. In high-throughput scenarios, therefore, users can utilize the server API directly, bypassing the need for a web-based frontend or installation of the P2Rank application. PrankWeb is available at http://prankweb.cz/, while the web application source code and the P2Rank method can be accessed at https://github.com/jendelel/PrankWebApp and https://github.com/rdk/p2rank, respectively.},

This requires a technique for obtaining normalized B-factors. Since then the exploitation of B-factors has been extensively elaborated and applied in a variety of studies with quite different goals, all having in common the identification and interpretation of rigidity, flexibility, and/or internal motion which are crucial in enzymes and in proteins in general. Importantly, this review includes a discussion of limitations and possible pitfalls when using B-factors. A second research area, which likewise exploits B-factors, is also reviewed, namely, the development of the so-called B-FIT-directed evolution method for increasing the thermostability of enzymes as catalysts in organic chemistry and biotechnology. In both research areas, a maximum of structural and mechanistic insights is gained when B-factor analyses are combined with other experimental and computational techniques.},

The As of these proteins can be determined to within 1 to 2% and that of their individual residues to within 10 to 20%. The As values of proteins are correlated with their molecular weight (Mr) in the range 4000 to 35,000: the power law As = 6.3 M0.73 predicts protein As values to within 4% on average. The average water-accessible surface is found to be 57% non-polar, 24% polar and 19% charged, with 5% root-mean-square variations. The molecular surface buried inside the protein is 58% non-polar, 39% polar and 4% charged. The buried surface contains more uncharged polar groups (mostly peptides) than the surface that remains accessible, but many fewer charged groups. On average, 15% of residues in small proteins and 32% in larger ones may be classed as "buried residues", having less than 5% of their surface accessible to the solvent. The accessibilities of most other residues are evenly distributed in the range 5 to 50%. Although the fraction of buried residues increases with molecular weight, the amino acid compositions of the protein interior and surface show no systematic variation with molecular weight, except for small proteins that are often very rich in buried cysteines. From amino acid compositions of protein surfaces and interiors we calculate an effective coefficient of partition for each type of residue, and derive an implied set of transfer free energy values. This is compared with other sets of partition coefficients derived directly from experimental data. The extent to which groups of residues (charged, polar and non-polar) are buried within proteins correlates well with their hydrophobicity derived from amino acid transfer experiments. Within these three groups, the correlation is low.},

Many structure-based drug design methods utilize such heuristic information for improving prediction or characterization of ligand-binding sites in proteins of unknown function. The Binding MOAD database if one of the largest curated sets of protein-ligand complexes, and provides a source of diverse, high-quality data for establishing general trends of residue composition from currently available protein structures. We present an analysis of 3,295 non-redundant proteins with 9,114 non-redundant binding sites to identify residues over-represented in binding regions versus the rest of the protein surface. The Binding MOAD database delineates biologically-relevant "valid" ligands from "invalid" small-molecule ligands bound to the protein. Invalids are present in the crystallization medium and serve no known biological function. Contacts are found to differ between these classes of ligands, indicating that residue composition of biologically relevant binding sites is distinct not only from the rest of the protein surface, but also from surface regions capable of opportunistic binding of non-functional small molecules. To confirm these trends, we perform a rigorous analysis of the variation of residue propensity with respect to the size of the dataset and the content bias inherent in structure sets obtained from a large protein structure database. The optimal size of the dataset for establishing general trends of residue propensities, as well as strategies for assessing the significance of such trends, are suggested for future studies of binding-site composition.},

The traditional measures of solvent exposure however suffer from various shortcomings, like for example the inability to distinguish exposed, partly exposed, buried, and deeply buried residues. This article introduces a new measure of solvent exposure called Half-Sphere Exposure that addresses many of the shortcomings of other methods. The new measure outperforms other measures with respect to correlation with protein stability, conservation among fold homologs, amino acid-type dependency and interpretation. The measure consists of the number of Calpha atoms in two half spheres around a residue's Calpha atom. Conceptually, one of the half spheres corresponds to the side chain's neighborhood, the other half sphere being in the opposite direction. We show here that the two half spheres correspond to two regions around an amino acid that are surprisingly distinct in terms of geometry and energy. This aspect of protein structure introduced here forms the basis of the Half-Sphere Exposure measure. The results strongly suggest that in many respects, a 2D measure is inherently much better suited to describe solvent exposure than the traditional 1D measures. Importantly, Half-Sphere Exposure can be calculated from the Calpha atom coordinates only, which abolishes the need for a full-atom model to calculate solvent exposure. Hence, the measure can be used in protein structure prediction methods that are based on various simplified models. Half-Sphere Exposure has great potential for use in protein structure prediction and analysis.},

  abstract        = {Peptide bonds in protein structures are mainly found in trans conformation with a torsion angle ω close to 180°. Only a very low proportion is observed in cis conformation with ω angle around 0°. Cis-trans isomerization leads to local conformation changes which play an important role in many biological processes. In this paper, we reviewed the recent discoveries and research achievements in this field. First, we presented some interesting cases of biological processes in which cis-trans isomerization is directly implicated. It is involved in protein folding and various aspect of protein function like dimerization interfaces, autoinhibition control, channel gating, membrane binding. Then we reviewed conservation studies of cis peptide bonds which emphasized evolution constraints in term of sequence and local conformation. Finally we made an overview of the numerous molecular dynamics studies and prediction methodologies already developed to take into account this structural feature in the research area of protein modeling. Many cis peptide bonds have not been recognized as such due to the limited resolution of the data and to the refinement protocol used. Cis-trans proline isomerization reactions represents a vast and promising research area that still needs to be further explored for a better understanding of isomerization mechanism and improvement of cis peptide bond predictions.},

  abstract        = {Intrinsic disorder (ID) is established as an important feature of protein sequences. Its use in proteome annotation is however hampered by the availability of many methods with similar performance at the single residue level, which have mostly not been optimized to predict long ID regions of size comparable to domains. Here, we have focused on providing a single consensus-based prediction, MobiDB-lite, optimized for highly specific (i.e. few false positive) predictions of long disorder. The method uses eight different predictors to derive a consensus which is then filtered for spurious short predictions. Consensus prediction is shown to outperform the single methods when annotating long ID regions. MobiDB-lite can be useful in large-scale annotation scenarios and has indeed already been integrated in the MobiDB, DisProt and InterPro databases. MobiDB-lite is available as part of the MobiDB database from URL: http://mobidb.bio.unipd.it/. An executable can be downloaded from URL: http://protein.bio.unipd.it/mobidblite/. silvio.tosatto@unipd.it. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
