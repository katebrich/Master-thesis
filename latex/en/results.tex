\section{Datasets}


The choice of datasets of protein-ligand complexes used for statistical analysis and P2Rank model training and evaluation was strongly inspired by the datasets described in the P2Rank article \cite{p2rank1}. The structures were re-downloaded directly from PDBe, according to their PDB ID (four-character alphanumeric identifier) and chain ID (one-character identifier) used in the original datasets. It was not possible to take the original datasets as they were, since the structures were not up-to-date and the annotations downloaded from the databases (e.g. feature values) could not be mapped properly.

Downloaded datasets were further checked and filtered: Obsolete structures were replaced with their current entries, structures that do not have a corresponding UniProt record were removed, as well as  structures with the incorrect segments mapping due to the bug in PDBe (mentioned in section TODO-ODKAZ).


The resulting datasets were named identically with the original datasets:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Chen11}
  - a smaller non-redundant dataset that was originally designed for a comparative study of ligand binding sites predictors \cite{benchmark}. It comprises at most one representative chain for every SCOP family \cite{scop} to ensure the minimal sequence similarity and maximal variability in tertiary structure. The original dataset covers 6 structural classes, 148 protein folds, 184 superfamilies and 251 families \cite{benchmark}; after re-downloading and filtering, the numbers are slightly smaller.
  
  \item \textbf{Coach420}
  - a dataset that was originally taken from a benchmark study \cite{cofactor} and used in other studies \cite{coach, p2rank1}. The non-redundant dataset harbor mix of natural and drug-like ligand molecules.
  
  \item \textbf{Joined}
  - smaller datasets from previous studies merged together in one larger dataset. It comprises a set of drug-target complexes extracted from DrugBank, DrugPort and PDB DT198\cite{dt}, a benchmark set for the validation of protein-ligand docking performance \cite{astex}, and a dataset with bound and unbound structures used for evaluation of a ligand binding sites predictor \cite{ligsite}.
  
  \item \textbf{Holo4k}
  - a large set of protein-ligand complexes used in a large-scale evaluation of four binding sites predictors \cite{holo4k}.
\end{itemize}
